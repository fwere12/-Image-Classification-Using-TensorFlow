# -Image-Classification-Using-TensorFlow
The objective of this project is to classify images into their respective categories using TensorFlow. The dataset contains images from 10 different categories. I am required to build a baseline image classification model and then optimize the model by incorporating transfer learning using a pre-trained model of my choice.
